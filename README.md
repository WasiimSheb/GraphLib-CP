# GraphLib: A Comprehensive C++ Graph Library

This repository contains a C++ library for representing and manipulating graphs using adjacency matrices. The library provides various functionalities including loading graphs, printing graph details, and performing arithmetic and comparison operations on graphs.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Create graphs with a specified number of vertices.
- **Graph Loading**: Load a graph from an adjacency matrix.
- **Graph Printing**: Print the graph details including the number of vertices and edges.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Support for graph addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and division.
- **Comparison Operations**: Compare graphs using various relational operators.
- **Increment and Decrement**: Increment or decrement the values in the adjacency matrix.
- **Stream Output**: Print the adjacency matrix of the graph using the stream output operator.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WasiimSheb/sp2exe2.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sp2exe2
    ```

## Compilation

Compile the source code using the provided `Makefile`:
```bash
make
```

## Usage

Navigate to the specific example folder and run the compiled executable. For example, to run the demo:
```bash
./Demo
```

## Files and Directories

- **Algorithms.cpp / Algorithms.hpp**: Implementation and header files for various graph algorithms.
- **Graph.cpp / Graph.hpp**: Core implementation of the graph class and its functionalities.
- **Demo.cpp**: Demonstrates the usage of the graph library.
- **Test.cpp / TestCounter.cpp**: Test files to validate the functionality of the library.
- **doctest.h**: Header file for the doctest framework used for testing.
- **Makefile**: Makefile for compiling the project.
